== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where are the customization features? =

This widget doesn't have any customization features. It simply inserts the PHP include call into any widgeted area you choose. 

Configuration of the Featured Content Gallery plugin itself is done on its own settings page. 

= How about support? =

The plugin is fairly easy to use, it's really click and drag and it activates. So, no configuration necessary.
